## Question 1
A _________ is an application security solution that can help to find certain vulnerabilities in web applications while they are running in production.

- ***Dynamic Analysis Security Testing***
- Static Analysis Security Testing
- Container security
- Software Composition Analysis

**Explanation:** Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST) can find vulnerabilities in web applications during runtime in a production environment. This is different from Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST), which examines code without executing it. Container security focuses on securing containerized environments, and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) identifies vulnerabilities in open-source components used in the application.

## Question 2
Which of the following DevSecOps tools allows an All-in-One website security scanner to support developers to detect problems at the most advanced stage?

- ***Acunetix***
- Codacy
- Aqua Security
- GitLab

**Explanation:** Acunetix is an All-in-One website security scanner designed to detect vulnerabilities at the most advanced stages of development. Codacy is primarily a code quality tool, Aqua Security focuses on container security, and GitLab is a comprehensive DevOps platform but not specialized as a website security scanner.

## Question 3
Vulnerability Scanning ensures that code is checked for vulnerabilities at every major stage of the delivery pipeline from the time it is written to, when it is deployed into production.

- ***True***
- False

**Explanation:** Vulnerability Scanning involves checking the code for security flaws at each significant stage of the delivery pipeline, ensuring that vulnerabilities are identified and addressed from development to deployment.

## Question 4
Use a SAST tool to ensure that your code is secure, safe, and reliable.

- ***True***
- False

**Explanation:** Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools analyze source code and binaries to identify security vulnerabilities, ensuring the code is secure, safe, and reliable before deployment.

## Question 5
\__________ refers to the process of tracking the identified vulnerabilities, the steps taken to mitigate and/or eliminate those vulnerabilities, and the overall status of the applicationâ€™s security.

- ***Monitor***
- Scan
- Analyze
- Remediate

**Explanation:** Monitoring involves continuously tracking identified vulnerabilities, the mitigation steps taken, and the overall security status of the application. Scanning is the initial detection of vulnerabilities, analyzing is examining these vulnerabilities in detail, and remediation refers to the process of fixing them.

# DevSecOps Part 3 post
## Question 1
__________ provides a summary of possible attack scenarios, outlines the flow of sensitive data, and identifies vulnerabilities and offers potential mitigation options.

- ***Threat Modeling***
- Scan
- Monitor
- Remediate

**Explanation:** Threat Modeling provides a comprehensive summary of possible attack scenarios, outlines the flow of sensitive data, identifies vulnerabilities, and offers potential mitigation options. Scanning, monitoring, and remediation are parts of the security process but do not offer the detailed analysis and preventive strategies that Threat Modeling does.

## Question 2
Runtime protection means securing software against threats that can arise when your application starts running.

- True
- ***False***

**Explanation:** Runtime protection involves securing applications during execution, but it doesn't encompass all potential threats. Proper security measures should be in place throughout the development lifecycle, not just at runtime.

## Question 3
_________ is an enterprise-grade automated code review solution that uses static code analysis to provide comprehensive vulnerability reporting.

- ***Codacy***
- Acunetix
- SonarQube
- Aqua Security

**Explanation:** Codacy is known for its enterprise-grade automated code review capabilities, utilizing static code analysis to provide comprehensive vulnerability reports. Acunetix is a web vulnerability scanner, SonarQube is also a static analysis tool but not primarily focused on automated code reviews, and Aqua Security specializes in container security.

## Question 4
___________ is an application security methodology for managing open source components.

- Container security
- Dynamic Analysis Security Testing
- Static Analysis Security Testing
- ***Software Composition Analysis***

**Explanation:** Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is the methodology used for managing open source components, identifying vulnerabilities in those components, and ensuring compliance with licensing requirements. Container security and Dynamic and Static Analysis Testing focus on different aspects of application security.

## Question 5
_______ is a web-based DevOps program that gives a full CI/CD toolchain out-of-the-box in one particular application.

- ***GitLab***
- Logz.io
- Aqua Security
- Contrast Security

**Explanation:** GitLab is a comprehensive DevOps platform providing a full CI/CD toolchain out-of-the-box in a single application. Logz.io is focused on log analysis, Aqua Security on container security, and Contrast Security on application security.
